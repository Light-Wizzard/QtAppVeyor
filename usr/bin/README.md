# QtAppVeyor

I have Qt C++ and QML applications that I wanted to make Qt Installers for, 
and I wanted to use [AppVeyor](https://appveyor.com),
figuring out how is a lot of work, and I could not find a Site that had a Turial on how to do this,
so I decided to make a Project just for AppVeyor deployments in Linux, Mac, and Windows,
I would like to add Android at some point, but I need to get these 3 working.

This is a simple application written in Qt C++ using Widgets, 
it is a simple app that has a settings page to enter in all the Variables needed to make an AppVeyor Yaml file,
so with a click of a bottom you can automate the creation of .appveyor.yml file.

This App is basically just to show you how to deploy Qt C++ QtCreator Projects,
on Linux, Mac, and Windows,
and how to use the Qt Installer Framework to make Installable applications.
