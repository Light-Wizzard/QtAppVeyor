<h1>Qt AppVeyor Help</h1>

<p>
    This Application has Tabs for every section,
    the Settings Tab is where you define what OS's you will be using,
    what Platform, and what Configuration. <br />
    The Defaults Tab is where you can overwrite all versions at once with the "Defauls" button,
    or individually with the "Reset" button on each Tab,
    note that blank fields should be ignorned.
</p>

<p>
    There is a Tab for each OS,
    you can set up each with different specifications,
    if you want to add another OS,
    just copy the code for one like it,
    and rename it,
    I made it so each database entery is an OS in a project,
    so each Tab has its own record in the Database. <br />
    OS means what OS you are Targetting,
    and not the one you are running on,
    unless you are Targetting it,
    as such, WebAssembly runs on Ubuntu,
    and iOS runs on Mac.
</p>

<p>
    This application is written to teach anyone interested in Deploying Qt Applications,
    the concept is to give an example of a running application,
    with most of the features you would want in a Database driven Application,
    I save the SQL setting in Qt Settings, in INI Format,
    I set the folder to QStandardPaths::AppConfigLocation,
    and keep most of the functions in the file MyOrgSettings,
    which you can access via myOrgDomainSetting.
    I store the Password for SQL Encrypted using SimpleCrypt,
    the Key is in MyOrgSettings: myCrypto = new SimpleCrypt(Q_UINT64_C(KEY));,
    and should be changed for secrurity reasons,
    not that this key can be used to hack the Password,
    it does make it so it only works with this key.
</p>

<p>
    I try to use Constants for any variable,
    so I have them in their own Class called QtAppVeyorConstants.h,
    you can access it through MyOrgSettings via myConstants,
    I use Qt Settings to save SQL Info to an Ini file,
    I use SQL to store the Configurations.
</p>

<p>
    There is an option to save the file.
</p>

<p>
    Below is a list of supported Databases, Sqlite is the easiest to use,
    and the only one I have test so far,
    I do plan on testing MySQL and PostgreSQL,
    but as long as all the fields are set,
    it should work in all of them.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>QSQLITE or QSQLITE2, SQLite version 3 SQLite version 2 Note: obsolete since Qt 5.14</li>
    <li>QMYSQL or MARIADB is MySQL or MariaDB (version 5.0 and above)</li>
    <li>QPSQL is PostgreSQL (versions 7.3 and above)</li>
    <li>QDB2 is IBM DB2 (version 7.1 and above)</li>
    <li>QIBASE is Borland InterBase</li>
    <li>QOCI Oracle Call Interface Driver</li>
    <li>QTDS is Sybase Adaptive Server - Note: obsolete since Qt 4.7</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The URLs you need to use at AppVeyor are listed below,
    you should always validate your .appveyor.yml file,
    and always use the encrypt tool to get your Encrypted Secret.
