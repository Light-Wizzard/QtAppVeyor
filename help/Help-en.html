<h1>Qt AppVeyor Help</h1>

<p>
    This Application is writen to make a basic template for your AppVeyor Yaml file,
    you need to validate it first at your "Validate YAML" button under your AppVeyor Account.
    This is called a concept application,
    the concept is that it runs,
    and has a purpose,
    which in this case is to make your .appveyor.yml template file,
    template implies you will need to make changes to it,
    if you want it to do more that it does,
    which is to use its own YAML output to deploy this project,
    thus the "Concept Application" proof.
</p>

<p>
    This Project is designed to Fork,
    and was written in hope AppVeyor would Fork,
    and move delopment to that site as the Offical Version.
</p>

<p>
    I tried to use as many features as most Qt Applications will require,
    so you can use this program as a Templete for new projects that might be like this,
    meaning it has tabs that have forms you need to fill out,
    and save, print, and save as PDF, all the features built into this application.
</p>

<p>
    This Application has Tabs for every section,
    the Settings Tab is where you define what OS's you will be using,
    what Platform, what Build Environment, and what Configuration. <br />
    The Defaults Tab is where you can overwrite all versions at once with the "Defauls" button,
    or individually with the "Reset" button on each Tab,
    note that blank fields should be ignorned.
</p>

<p>
    There is a Tab for each OS,
    you can set up each with different specifications,
    if you want to add another OS,
    just copy the code for one like it,
    and rename it,
    I made it so each database entery is an OS in a project,
    so each Tab has its own record in the Database. <br />
    OS means what OS you are Targetting,
    and not the one you are running on,
    unless you are Targetting it,
    as such, WebAssembly runs on Ubuntu,
    and iOS runs on Mac.
</p>

<p>
    This application is written to teach anyone interested in Deploying Qt Applications,
    the concept by example of a running application,
    with most of the features you would want in a Database driven Application,
    I save the SQL setting in Qt Settings, in INI Format,
    I set the folder to QStandardPaths::AppConfigLocation,
    and keep most of the functions in the file MyOrgSettings,
    which you can access via myOrgDomainSetting.
    I store the Password for SQL Encrypted using SimpleCrypt,
    the Key is in MyOrgSettings: myCrypto = new SimpleCrypt(Q_UINT64_C(KEY));,
    and should be changed for secrurity reasons,
    not that this key can be used to hack the Password,
    it does make it so it only works with this key,
    so if you alter it will running it,
    you will get locked out,
    but you can update the INI file by hand,
    and why it is encrypt to begin with.
</p>

<p>
    I try to use Constants for any variable,
    so I have them in their own Class called QtAppVeyorConstants.h,
    you can access it through MyOrgSettings via myConstants,
    I use Qt Settings to save SQL Info to an Ini file,
    I use SQL to store the Configurations.
</p>

<p>
    There is an option to save the file,
    this can be used to deploy your own project.
</p>

<p>
    Below is a list of supported Databases, Sqlite is the easiest to use,
    and the only one I have tested so far,
    I do plan on testing MySQL and PostgreSQL,
    but as long as all the fields are set,
    it should work in all of them without testing them,
    and why I did not test them,
    I wrote some of this code years ago,
    and it worked back then,
    and so I did test it at some point,
    but if you have an issue just file an issue.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>QSQLITE or QSQLITE2, SQLite version 3 SQLite version 2 Note: obsolete since Qt 5.14</li>
    <li>QMYSQL or MARIADB is MySQL or MariaDB (version 5.0 and above)</li>
    <li>QPSQL is PostgreSQL (versions 7.3 and above)</li>
    <li>QDB2 is IBM DB2 (version 7.1 and above)</li>
    <li>QIBASE is Borland InterBase</li>
    <li>QOCI Oracle Call Interface Driver</li>
    <li>QTDS is Sybase Adaptive Server - Note: obsolete since Qt 4.7</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The URLs you need to use at AppVeyor are listed below,
    you should always validate your .appveyor.yml file,
    and always use the encrypt tool to get your Encrypted Secret.
