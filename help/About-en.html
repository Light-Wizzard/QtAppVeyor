<h1>Qt AppVeyor About</h1>

<p>
    Every program needs a reason to exist,
    this one exist becasue I was working on a project to update my Galaxy Calculator from QML,
    to C++, so this Qt Application I want to work on as many Platforms as possible,
    having had Galaxy Calculator program on AppVeyor for a while,
    I decided to give it a try,
    but soon found it hard to get my project to work on Windows and Linux,
    that program is more complex with Library's,
    so I wanted to write a short Application that did something usefull to exist,
    but at the same time it was only to test my AppVeyor Scripts,
    it was then I decided why not make an AppVeyor Script Automation Tool,
    and now my concept is to use the Yaml Script this Application puts out to deploy this Application.
</p>

<p>
    This Application is written with hope AppVeyor would take it over,
    but first I have to make sure it works 100% before I even think about it,
    so this is an on going effort to get this 100%,
    so if you work for AppVeyor,
    it is your call if you want to move it over your repository,
    otherwise, this project is to help others with Qt Application Deployment.
